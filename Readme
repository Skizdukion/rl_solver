# plan:
1. Create CARO game env ( Use GymENV and extended it )
2. apply PPO to solve CARO
3. apply deep cfr to solve CARO 
4. apply dream to solve CARO ?
5. apply alpha zero to solve CARO ? Probably no
6. Use open siel -> extend caro -> use their algorithims to solve caro
7. Compare a few method and let them face each other
8. Online testing
9. Big 2 game implementation in open siel
10. use PPO to solve this
11. use deep cfr to solve this
12. use dream to solve this
13. use deep cfr + onlive solver to compare
14. a few alternative cfr algorithims to solve this
