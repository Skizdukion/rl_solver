# plan:
1. Create CARO game env ( Use GymENV and extended it )  16 x 16
2. apply PPO to solve CARO
3. apply deep cfr/deep mccfr to solve CARO
4. apply dream to solve CARO ?
5. Use open siel -> extend caro -> use their algorithims to solve caro
6. Compare a few method and let them face each other
7. Online testing
8. Big 2 game implementation in open siel
9. use PPO to solve this
10. use deep cfr / deep mccfr to solve this
11. use dream to solve this
12. use deep cfr + onlive solver to compare
13. a few alternative cfr algorithims to solve this
