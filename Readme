# plan:
* Create GridWorldEnv and solve it with PPO - Done
* Gym Env paralel with early terminated on big world
* View the training results
* Create CARO game env ( Use GymENV and extended it )  16 x 16
* apply PPO to solve CARO with basic opponent
* self play PPO with exploration parameter
* train in google collab
* apply deep cfr/deep mccfr to solve CARO -> No
* apply dream to solve CARO -> No
* Use open siel -> extend caro -> use their algorithims to solve caro
* Compare a few method and let them face each other
* Online testing
* Big 2 game implementation in open siel
* use PPO to solve this
* use deep cfr / deep mccfr to solve this
* use dream to solve this
* use deep cfr + onlive solver to compare
* a few alternative cfr algorithims to solve this
